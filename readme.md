## NPM Packages used ðŸ“¦

- **Global State Management:**  
  Utilized React Context API to manage and share global state across the application.

- **Styling:**  
  Leveraged [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a utility-first approach to styling.

- **Routing:**  
  Managed navigation and route handling using [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/).

- **Form Handling:**  
  Adopted [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for seamless form validation and submission.

- **Data Fetching & Caching:**  
  Leveraged [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for fetching data, caching query results, and managing cache invalidation. Combined with [react-intersection-observer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intersection-observer) and `useInfiniteQuery` to implement infinite scrolling, allowing continuous content loading without pagination controls.

- **API Requests:**  
  Utilized [axios](https://axios-http.com/) to make API requests to the backend. An `axiosInstance` is configured to include the JWT in the Authorization header for secure communication.
- **Date Formatting:**  
  Employed [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) to format dates in a user-friendly way.

- **Image Compression:**  
  Used [browser-image-compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-image-compression) to efficiently compress post images and user avatars before upload.

- **Notifications:**  
  Integrated [react-toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/) to display success and error messages for API requests.

- **JWT Management:**  
  Used [jwt-decode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-decode) to decode JWT tokens. The application checks token expiration and automatically deletes the token, username, and avatar if the token has expired.
